      "Good for Atlas Peak for holding this Cabernet for more than five years before releasing it. It's still tannic and young, with intense blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors that are dry and spicy. Showing an elegant mouthfeel, it needs a little more time. Hold until 2015, but it could develop over the next decade.\n",

      "Here's a top-shelf expression of Pinot Grigio that shares the best qualities of a high-level white wine. In fact, it offers a whole new face for the popular Italian white wine thanks to its complexity and rich density. It delivers aromas of mature fruit, vanilla cream, honeysuckle and stone fruit.\n",

      "You'll find this underrated producer offers wines with wonderful density and concentration, ripely balanced, plummy, mixed red fruits, and elegantly astringent tannins. There is real winemaking craft on display here, every detail beautifully rendered, substantial but not out of whack in any way. The fragrant, evocative results showcase the fruit but also buttress it with properly managed acids, tannins and new oak.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tender notes of ripe, juicy pear with more golden inflections of ripe yellow plum and peach on nose and palate close into a central seam of bright, sprightly and immensely toning acidity. Lightness, concentration and lip-smacking freshness are framed by rounded fruit. Structure and grace signal ageing potential. The finish is wonderfully dry and full of verve.\n",

      "\n",
      "This opens with a very pretty nose composed of rose petals, pear, orange peel and orange liqueur. Soft and pretty, it shows the feminine side of Viognier, avoids the bitterness and excessive alcohol that can detract from its elegance. A lovely springtime apéritif.\n",
      "Predicted:  12.161438 Actual:  19.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Coming in at a low (for Washington) alcohol level for this variety, this 100% Grenache shows light aromas of mint and other herbs with elusive raspberry and plum accents. It's medium bodied with an elegant, supple feel, showing little obvious new-oak influence to the red fruit flavors. A very intriguing wine where the texture plays a starring role in the show.\n",

      "Pure, condensed and dark on the nose, with blasting aromas of blackberry, crusty spice and char, this is packed like an overstuffed suitcase, with flavors of jammy black fruit, fine herbs and spice. Shows more big fruit on the finish and plenty of lasting berry flavor. Drink now through 2014.\n",
      "Predicted:  29.357147 Actual:  42.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Opens with red fruit aromas that are like a million other generic red wines, while the body has size, grab and stickiness. Flavors of cola, cherry, cassis and plum are red in nature and basically good, while the finish is candied but not overly so. An everyman's Cabernet in every sense of the word.\n",
      "Predicted:  15.786141 Actual:  12.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Snappy yet smooth, with subtle apple, toast and vanilla aromas. Very good in terms of feel, with dry, spicy flavors of baked apple, white pepper and herbs. Slightly mature notes of mushroom and Sherry rise up on the finish, lending this bubbly added complexity. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.\n",
      "Predicted:  24.327541 Actual:  36.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Dry tannins dominate this rough-edged wine. There are plenty of bitter cherry and cocoa flavors, while the acidity gives an attractive freshness. Those tannins need a year to settle down.\n",

      "This is a thin, unfussy wine that imparts bell pepper and asparagus in a sea of green flavor.\n",

      "\n",
      "Some of Seghesio's plantings are over a century old, and the wine has a classic, briary quality to it. Supple and inviting, it drinks well now but has the balance and structure to age for a few years.\n",
      "Predicted:  19.721176 Actual:  18.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink.\n",
      "Predicted:  46.482277 Actual:  55.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a floral take on Merlot, in both scents and flavors; owing at least in part to the inclusion of 7% Petit Verdot. The wine gathers strength and fleshes out as it warms in the glass, and layers in darker notes with smoke and coffee and tar. A steely style, muscular and tight, it smoothes out nicely with breathing time, and shows excellent aging potential.\n",
      "Predicted:  70.60307 Actual:  70.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Oaky, with butterscotch, vanilla cream and caramel flavors that swamp the underlying pineapple and pear fruit. If you're a fan of super-oaked Chardonnays, it's for you.\n",
      "Predicted:  23.742453 Actual:  25.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Grassy and herbal on the nose, then shows more stone-fruit flavors on the palate. Turns dry and stony on the finish. Imported by Sauvage Selections.\n",
      "Predicted:  13.419051 Actual:  15.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Medium bodied and dry, this has a savory spiciness, with long-lasting flavors of cherry and smoky, vanilla-scented oak. A coating of finely ground tannins gives it enough bite to accompany steak. One of the best Cabernet Francs from the Russian River Valley in a long time.\n",
      "Predicted:  52.997128 Actual:  28.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Simple jammy aromas lead to a hard, acidic palate offers some red fruit flavor but also an undercurrent of field greens. A lasting streak of bell pepper on the finish doesn't help bring it around.\n",
      "Predicted:  9.206938 Actual:  10.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Tasted at more than four years of age, this is a standout effort in a series that dates back to the mid-1990s. A complex nose greets you with a floral, dusty tickle, leading into a fruit-packed wine, with blueberry and black cherry most evident. Notes of black olive and graphite come through on the long finish, with exceptional grip and polish.\n",
      "Predicted:  41.07596 Actual:  45.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Dramatically structured and flavored, this is a tough, young mountain wine that deserves to be cellared. It's perfectly dry, with distinct flavors of blackberries, green olives, cocoa and new oak, but those tannins assault with youthful astringency. Give this wine four or five years to soften.\n",
      "Predicted:  48.071102 Actual:  35.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Bitter black cherries are the hallmark of this rather hard-edged wine. It shows dark tannins and fruit that misses full richness. Maybe it is restrained power, maybe it will age, but the balance is not there now.\n",
      "Predicted:  34.021683 Actual:  36.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes all you need is a nice, inexpensive Merlot to go with that steak, and this is a good one. It's dry and fruity, a little rough around the edges, with rich berry-cherry flavors and a full, complete mouthfeel.\n",
